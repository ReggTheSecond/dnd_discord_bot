Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your Spellbook. You can cast those Spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the Spells you chose for different Spells of the same levels."

level_twenty_ability_description: "When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful Spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard Spells in your Spellbook as your signature Spells. You always have these Spells prepared, they don't count against the number of Spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nArcane Traditions\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around The Schools of Magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of Spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the Spells of each school require mastery of different techniques."
